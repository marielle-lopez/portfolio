## Task Completion History

### February 1, 2024

- Completed About page using newly created components (i.e., CapsuleImg, EducationCard, PageLine) and relevant containers

Today, I worked on the About page of my portfolio application. My design for this page involved sections of similar design and layout, so I made components for these; EducationCard, CapsuleImg, and PageLine. I also developed a JSON file for my education information. Using these components and data, I constructed my About page as close as I could to my planned design!

### January 31, 2024

- Created Header component and added relevant content (i.e., NavBar component, external links, 'Download CV' button)

With new knowledge on React development, it was time to revamp my portfolio website.

As usual, I went to [Dribbble](https://www.dribble.com/) and searched for some inspiration for the design of my portfolio. I got to work on Figma and came up with a mockup for my landing page.

I then set up a Vite React application and created the planned pages in order to construct the Header component. I added the relevant content to such component, and applied styling according to my design mockup. I managed to add all the content to my planned landing page as well.

## Issues

- `favicon.ico` does not appear in browser tab with path as `/favicon.ico`, only with `/public/favicon.ico`
- Active link still adopts hover effects
- 'Download CV' button does not utilise Button component
- Fix en dash symbol in EducationCard component
