## To-Do

## Task Completion History

### January 31, 2024

- Created Header component and added relevant content (i.e., NavBar component, external links, 'Download CV' button)

With new knowledge on React development, it was time to revamp my portfolio website.

As usual, I went to [Dribbble](https://www.dribble.com/) and searched for some inspiration for the design of my portfolio. I got to work on Figma and came up with a mockup for my landing page.

I then set up a Vite React application and created the planned pages in order to construct the Header component. I added the relevant content to such component, and applied styling according to my design mockup.

## Issues

- `favicon.ico` does not appear in browser tab with path as `/favicon.ico`, only with `/public/favicon.ico`
- Active link still adopts hover effects
- 'Download CV' button does not utilise Button component
