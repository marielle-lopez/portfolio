## Time Completion History

### January 31, 2024

With new knowledge on React development, it was time to revamp my portfolio website.

As usual, I went to [Dribbble](https://www.dribble.com/) and searched for some inspiration for the design of my portfolio. I got to work on Figma and came up with a mockup for my landing page.

## Issues

- `favicon.ico` does not appear in browser tab with path as `/favicon.ico`, only with `/public/favicon.ico`
